# SPECFEM2D

SPECFEM2D allows users to perform 2D and 2.5D (i.e., axisymmetric) simulations
of acoustic, elastic, viscoelastic, and poroelastic seismic wave propagation.

The upgraded SPECFEM2D package can be used to calculate the sensitivity kernels
for isotropic-, VTI-, TTI- and visco-elastic FWI with different model parameterizations.


Main "historical" developers: Dimitri Komatitsch and Jeroen Tromp
  (there are currently many more!)
