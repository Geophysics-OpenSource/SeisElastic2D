# SeisElastic2D
SeisElastic2D is an open-source package for multiparameter FWI in isotropic-, anisotropic- and visco-elastic media built upon several exiting packages including SPECFEM2D, seisDD, etc. Note that the SPECFEM2D package has modifed to calculate the sensitivity kernels in isotropic-, VTI-, TTI- and visco-elastic media with various model parameterizations.


Currently, the package consists of the following
